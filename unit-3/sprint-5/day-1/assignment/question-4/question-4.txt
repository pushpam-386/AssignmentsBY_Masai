--Exception classes are categoried in 2 category:

1.checked exception  (checked by java compiler whether we have handled that exception or not ) 
2.unchecked exception (not checked by the compiler)



whether exception is checked or unchecked, exception always occurs at runtime.it never occurs at compile time. compile time only occurs compilation error.


--in the process of checking compiler will not bother even we don't handle object of some exception classes.

--but there are some statements for which applying the concept of exception handling is mandatory at compile time itself.
if we don't handle them then compiler will generate a compile time error.

the exception class object for which compiler force us to handle them at compile time only are knwon as checked excception 

ex:

ClassNotFoundException
IOException
SQLException

and for those exception classes compiler will not force us (it ignores ) at compile time to handle are known as unchecked exceptions:

AE , NPE,CCE,AIOBE, NFE
 




RuntimeException and its child classes considered as unchecked exception (runtime exceptions)
--if some statement in our java code may generate these classes object, handling these classes object at compiler time is optional.

Exception class and its child class except RuntimeException class is knwon as checked exception, 
--if some statement in our java code may generate these classes object, handling these classes object at compile time is mandatory, otherwise compiler will generate compile time error.
