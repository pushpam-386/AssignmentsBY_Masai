Q4 What is instance of operator explain with an example?

Ans-: The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance of the
specified type (class or subclass or interface).

The instanceof in java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the 
instance with type. It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator 
with any variable that has null value, it returns false.
