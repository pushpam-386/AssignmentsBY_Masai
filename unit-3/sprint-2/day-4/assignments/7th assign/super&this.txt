The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to immediate
parent class object.
Whenever you create the instance of a subclass, an instance of parent class is created
implicitly which is referred by the super reference variable.


Usage of Java super Keyword
1. super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable.
2. super can be used to invoke the immediate parent class method.
3. super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.


Example1: referring to the immediate parent class instance variable:
class Animal{
String color="white";
}
class Dog extends Animal{
String color="black";
void printColor(){
System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class
System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class
}
}
class Main{
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog d=new Dog();
d.printColor();
}
}
