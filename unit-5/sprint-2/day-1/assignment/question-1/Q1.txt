limitation of EM methods in performing CRUD operations:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------

only 4 methods are there:-

persist();
find()
merge();
remove();



1.Retrieving Entity obj based on only ID field(PK field) @Id

2.multiple Entity obj retrival is not possible (multiple record)

3.bulk update and bulk delete is also not possible

4.to access Entity obj we can not specify some extra condition.


--to overcome the above limitation JPA has provided JPQL (java persistence query language).
