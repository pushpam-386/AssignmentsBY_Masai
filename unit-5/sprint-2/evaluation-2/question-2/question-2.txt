QuestionQ2/- Explain the difference between JPA and Hibernate, and
What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?


JPA

===============================================
JPA is described in javax.persistence package.	

It describes the handling of relational data in Java applications.                                                                        	

It is not an implementation. It is only a Java specification.	

It is used in mapping Java data types with SQL data types and database tables.

As an object-oriented query language, it uses Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) to execute database operations.

To interconnect with the entity manager factory for the persistence unit, it uses EntityManagerFactory interface. Thus, it gives an entity manager.

To make, read, and remove actions for instances of mapped entity classes, it uses EntityManager interface. 



Hibernate

=================================================

Hibernate is described in org.hibernate package.

Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that is used to save the Java objects in the relational database system.

Hibernate is an implementation of JPA. Hence, the common standard which is given by JPA is followed by Hibernate.
It is a standard API that permits to perform database operations.

To create Session instances, it uses SessionFactory interface.

 It acts as a runtime interface between a Java application and Hibernate.


======================================================================================

The advantages of Hibernate over JDBC are:

1. Hibernate code will work well for all databases, for ex: Oracle,MySQL, etc. 
where as JDBC is database specific.

2. No knowledge of SQL is needed because Hibernate is a set of objects and a table is
treated as an object, where as to work with JDBC, one need to know SQL.

3. Query tuning is not required in Hibernate. The query tuning is automatic in hibernate 
by using criteria queries, and the result of performance is at its best. Where as in JDBC 
the query tuning is to be done by the database authors.

4. With the support of cache of hibernate, the data can be placed in the cache for better 
performance. Where as in JDBC the java cache is to be implemented.
