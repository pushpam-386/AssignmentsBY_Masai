the response, then send a response back to the webserver. 

Properties of Servlets are as follows:

Dispatcher Servlet---->>
Any request is going to come into our website the front controller is going to stand in 
front and is going to accept all the requests and once the front controller accepts that 
request then this is the job of the front controller that it will make a decision that who 
is the right controller to handle that request. 

DispatcherServlet handles an incoming HttpRequest, delegates the request, and processes that 
request according to the configured HandlerAdapter interfaces that have been implemented within 
the Spring application along with accompanying annotations specifying handlers, controller endpoints, 
and response objects.
