Difference between setter and constructor injection:

Constructor----->>>>
It may cause circular dependency 

If the dependency is mandatory 

If the dependency is "final" variable then
it must be injected through the
constructor injection only

constructor injected values will be
accessible to setter method

constructor injected value can not
override the setter injected value.

Setter----->>>>
If the dependency is optional

It resolve the circular dependency

It can override the constructor injected value.

setter injected value can not be accessible through
the constructor.

We can not inject the final variable through the
setter
