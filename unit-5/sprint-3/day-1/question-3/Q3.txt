challanges to develop Enterprise application:
==================================

--An Enterprise application is bydefault a Distributed application,becoz Enterprise application is divided into seperate modules, and each module can be a independent application, here each module will colaborate each other and provide services as a whole.

1. data security : the data exchange should be encrypted and decrepted. authentication and authorization.

2. client can access the application in platform and language independent form, i.e presentation logic should be web-enabled. so client can access the application through browser.

presentation could be GUI : that can be access by the browser (webapplication), they are not reusable
or 
could be raw data  (JSON or xml format)  (webservices) generating the api , they are reusable


GoAir: -------> webapplication ---------------> GUI ----> book the ticket (it is used by the end-user )
   |
   --------------> it is having a webservices which generates a REST api and raw data (in json or xml format) (it is used by other application)


Yarta: webapplication------------->GUI ----->book the ticket 


3. transaction management: (either everything or nothing should happen )

4. logging 

5.messaging 

6.mailing 

etc..
