Difference between AS and WebServer:
===============================

Java Based Web-server is a small part/ subset of Application server s/w.

--ApplicationServer contains both EJB container and ServletContainer s/w
where as WebServer contains only Servlet Container s/w.

--AS can be communicated with any kind of protocol ex: http, ftp, smtp, etc
whereas WS can be communicated only using Http protol.


--mostly used java based Web server s/w is: Apache Tomcat server.


--Container is a special type of s/w which provides runtime support (execution environment) to our components.



****Note: After Spring, we don't need AS anymore, using a WebServer also we can develop an EA.
