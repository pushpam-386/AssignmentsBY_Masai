JPA Application:-
---------------------

any java application, that uses JPA api to perform persistnce operation (CRUD ) operation with 
the DB s/w is called as JPA application.

JPA architecture:-
--------------------

Entity class or persistence class:-
--------------------------------------

--it is a class using which we map our table.

--if we are using the annotaion, then we need not map this class with the table inside the xml mapping file.

--an Entity class or persistence class is a java class that is developed corresponding to a table of DB.  

--this class has many instance variables should be there as same as columns in the corresponding table

--we should take Entity class as a POJO class.

--we need to provide mapping information with the table in this class only using annotaitons.

Note:- when we gives this persistance /Entity class obj to the ORM s/w, then ORM s/w will 
decide the destination DB s/w based on the configuration done in a xml file which is called as hibernate-configuration file.
