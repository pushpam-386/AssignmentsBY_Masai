Hibernate:- it is one of the ORM based framework s/w.  other s/w are :- toplink,ibatis,etc..

JPA:- (Java persistence api) :- it is an open specification given by Oracle corp,  to develop any ORM based s/w .

JPA provides a standard api to work with any kind of ORM based s/w .

JPA api belongs from "javax.persistence" package.

--Hibernate is one of the most frequently used JPA implementation

--HB provides its own api to develop ORM based persistence logic , if we use those api then
our application will become vendor lock, ie we can not port our application accross multiple 
ORM s/w. 

--HB api comes in the form of "org.hibernate" package.


Note:- we get the JPA api , along with any ORM s/w , becoz all the ORM s/w implements 
JPA specification.
