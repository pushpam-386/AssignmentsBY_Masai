Question 1:
What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?


Anwer---->>

Hibernate--It is one of the implementation of ORM based Framework software.

Limitations of JDBC based Persistence logic:--

1.JBDC code is the database dependent code because it uses software dependent 
query.

2.JDBC code throws lot of Checked Exception.

3.JDBC have to repeat the boiler plate code.

4.JDBC can't store the java objects into table directly.

5.JDBC reqires each time connection to execute any query.


--Inorder to overcome these limitations we use hibernate software using ORM 
approach for Entity mapping.


There are many software of ORM approach like--:
Hibernate, Toplink, Ibatis, Etc..

Hibernate::-->>>>

1.It provides abstraction layer.

2.No need to download and add dependencies.

3.Each object acts as row in a table.

4.Each column is mapped with Class instance variable.

5.To need to create connection each time.

6.No need to provide query to do DML, DRl manupulation from databses.

7.Easy to access data in more acceble form.

8.Most used technology used in DATA logic layer.

9.Hibernate used its own api also it use JPA api to create uniformity.

10.JPA provide platform independent work flow.
