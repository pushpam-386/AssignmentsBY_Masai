A. What is normalization and why is it needed?

Answer-->Normalization is process to avoid data duplication.
      -->To avoid insertion anomaly, update anomaly and deletion anomaly.
      -->To maximize the efficiency of a database.
      -->There are many types of Normalization.
     
       ==>1NF (First Normal Form)
       ==>2NF (Second Normal Form)
       ==>3NF (Third Normal Form)
       ==>BCNF
       ==>4NF
       ==>5NF
       ==>6NF





B. Explain the difference between an insert anomaly, update anomaly and delete anomaly.

Answer-->Update anomalies: If one copy of such repeated data is updated, an inconsistency is
created. unless all copies are similarly updated (inconsistency is when two copies of the
same data do not match. In such cases we cannot decide which copy is right and the data is
said to become inconsistent).

Insertion anomalies: It may not be possible to store some information unless some other
information is stored well.

Deletion anomalies: It may not be possible to delete some information without losing some
other information as well.
