In order to maintain consistancy in DB , before and after the tx certain properties should be followd 
these are called ACID properties:

A: (Atomicity) : (All or noting rule) the entire tx takes place at once or does not happens at all.

C: Consistancy: the DB must be consistant before and after tx

I: Isoloation: multiple tx should occurs independently at a time without any interference.

D: Durability: The changes of a sucessfull tx should be permanent even if system failure occurs.


--if we perform any DML operation on a table inside a tx area, that operation will be 
partically commited(it will be stored in the local copy)

--and any time we can rollback these operation

--but once we  do commit, then only it will be stored permanently.

Note: In Mysql it is bydefault autocommit is enabled.

Note: in the DB all the DDL statements are by default commited.

--in mysql to disable the autocommit mode:

>set aut0commit = 0;

to start the tx area in mysql:

>start transaction

>delete from x1 where id= 102;

>rollback;

>delete from x1 where id= 102;

>commit;
 

savepoint p1;
